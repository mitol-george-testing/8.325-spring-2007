description: The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN's Large Hadron Collider
  will, once it is built, look for the Higgs boson and evidence of physics beyond
  the standard model. This image is a simulation depicting the decay of a Higgs particle
  following a collision of two protons in the CMS experiment. (Image courtesy of CERN.)
